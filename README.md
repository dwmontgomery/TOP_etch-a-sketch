# The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

## Objective

Create an Etch-A-Sketch website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Tasks

<ol>
    <li>Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. </li>
    <li>Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over 
        them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. </li>
    <li>Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the 
        number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be 
        removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 
        960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. </li>
</ol>
